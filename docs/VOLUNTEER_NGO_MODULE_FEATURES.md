- **Available Resources**: Count of uncommitted aid offers
- **Fulfillment Rate**: Percentage of completed vs. total requests
- **Needs Verification**: Reports awaiting official confirmation

#### **Demand-Supply Overview Card**
- **Visual Progress Bar**: Shows demand-to-supply ratio
- **Smart Alerts**:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è High demand (>80% ratio) - more resources needed
  - ‚öñÔ∏è Moderate demand (40-80% ratio) - balanced
  - ‚úÖ Good supply (<40% ratio) - sufficient resources

- Active volunteer engagement

**Calculations**:
```javascript
// Demand-Supply Ratio
demandSupplyRatio = (pendingRequests / availableOffers) * 100

// Fulfillment Rate
fulfillmentRate = (fulfilledRequests / totalRequests) * 100

// Critical vs. High Priority
criticalCount = requests.filter(r => r.urgency === "critical").length
highPriorityCount = requests.filter(r => r.urgency === "high").length
```

**How to Use**:
1. Go to "Volunteer Hub" from sidebar
2. View the main dashboard
3. Check the "Demand-Supply Overview" card for:
   - Current demand/supply ratio

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

**Main Dashboard**:
```typescript
// Location: client/src/pages/VolunteerDashboard.tsx
- StatCard: Metric display cards
- ResourceRequestPreview: Quick view of pending requests
- AidOfferPreview: Preview of personal aid offers
- ReportToVerify: Preview of reports needing confirmation
- Tabs: Organize different sections
- Real-time queries with TanStack Query
```

**Data Fetching**:
```typescript
// Queries
const { data: allRequests } = useQuery(["/api/resource-requests"]);
const { data: allOffers } = useQuery(["/api/aid-offers"]);
const { data: myOffers } = useQuery(["/api/aid-offers/mine"]);
const { data: reports } = useQuery(["/api/reports"]);
const { data: user } = useQuery(["/api/auth/user"]);
```

**Filtering Logic**:
```typescript
// Pending requests
const pendingRequests = allRequests.filter(r => r.status === "pending");

// Critical priority
const criticalRequests = pendingRequests.filter(r => r.urgency === "critical");

// Unconfirmed reports (3+ verifications)
const unconfirmedReports = reports.filter(
  r => !r.confirmedBy && r.status === "reported" && r.verificationCount >= 3
);
```
