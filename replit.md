# Crisis Connect - Real-Time Disaster Management Platform

## Overview

Crisis Connect is a real-time disaster management and emergency response coordination platform. Its core purpose is to facilitate rapid incident reporting with GPS tracking and media, enable crowd-sourced verification of reports, and coordinate emergency response efforts. The platform uses AI for validation, automatically detecting duplicate and potentially fake reports. It is designed with a mobile-first approach, prioritizing speed and clarity crucial for emergency situations, aiming to improve data quality and streamline relief operations.

**Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store.
**Middleware**: JSON body parsing, request logging, secure session management, Passport.js for authentication.

### Database Architecture

**ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (Neon serverless driver).
**Schema**:
-   **Sessions**: For Replit Auth.
-   **Users**: From Replit Auth (email, name, image, UUID).
-   **Disaster Reports**: Type (13 categories including epidemic, road_accident, landslide, gas_leak, building_collapse, chemical_spill, power_outage, water_contamination), severity, status, location, GPS coordinates, media URLs (photos/videos/audio), AI validation score, reporter ID, verification count, timestamps.
-   **Verifications**: Links users to reports to prevent duplicate votes.
-   **Resource Requests**: Type, urgency, status, quantity, description, location, GPS, requester ID, fulfillment tracking.

## Recent Updates (October 30, 2025)

### Report Verification System (Latest)
- **Community Trust Rating**: Users can upvote or downvote disaster reports to indicate trust/reliability
- **Consensus Scoring Algorithm**: Combines community votes (Â±5 points per net vote), verifications (+10 points each, max 50), AI validation (0-20 points), and NGO/official confirmation (+30 bonus) to generate a 0-100 consensus score
- **Trust Badges**: Visual indicators showing trust levels:
  - Highly Trusted (80-100): Green badge with shield check icon
  - Trusted (60-79): Blue badge with shield icon
  - Moderate (40-59): Yellow badge with shield icon
  - Low Trust (20-39): Orange badge with shield alert icon
  - Unverified (0-19): Red badge with warning icon
- **Vote Management**: Users can cast upvote or downvote (or change/remove their vote), cannot vote on own reports
- **Real-time Updates**: Vote changes broadcast to all connected clients via WebSocket
- **Database Schema**: New `report_votes` table tracking user votes per report, added `upvotes`, `downvotes`, and `consensusScore` fields to disaster reports

### Enhanced Map Visualization
- Added heatmap layer using leaflet.heat for report density visualization with severity-weighted intensity
- Implemented layer control panel for toggling shelters, evacuation zones, and major roads overlays

- Heatmap intensity calculation based on severity levels (critical=1.0, high=0.7, medium=0.5, low=0.3)
- Consensus scoring uses weighted algorithm to prevent gaming and ensure reliability
- Vote operations include rate limiting via existing verification limiter
- Demo overlay data included for shelters, evacuation zones, and major roads (production requires real data sources)
